	Motion:
-Moves forward with tank controls
-Passively steers forward direction left or right smoothly
-Once reaching level boundary, turns to face player's position (or a nearby point, depending on aggression value?)
-Randomly pauses to look around (becomes harder to see?)
-(Randomly pauses when nearby and facing the player, starts approaching immediately when player makes eye contact)

	Hunting:
-Conical FoV at head
-Detection based both on movement and line of sight, balance staying still and reaching for cover
-Gains "suspicion" when player enters conical FoV or moves in close proximity
-At half suspicion, monster slows down and looks at player
-At max suspicion, monster initiates attack

	Attack:
-Monster launches grasping arms which land after a delay with some inaccuracy, like tethered projectiles 
-Arm hit initiates struggle

	Struggle:
-Locks controls and turns the camera to face the monster
-(easy)QTE to stab the arm to break free
-Avoids monster or player clipping into walls
